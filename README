------------ 1.0 What is "libacinfo" --------------

This library implements a generic and easy interface
for Aqua Computer (AC) USB devices. The AC devices are 
for water-cooled computer systems and are manufactured by the 
German company 'Aqua Computer' (http://www.aqua-computer.de).
The first version of my tool was initially developed by me,
because there was no linux tool to monitor the information of an "Aquastream XT".
Mandatory information was gathered from the 'Aquasuite' Windows(TM) software.

It is planned to support more AC devices, especially other USB devices
which use the Human Interface Device (HID) class as base.

To get an impression of the design, take a look at 'libacinfo.png'.

NOTE: The API is unstable. Maybe I missed some functionality.

Supported Hardware:

	- Aquastream XT
	
	
TODO:
	- add functions to write settings
	- extend API
	- complete sample application(s)
	- give small intro in Wiki
	- Aquasuite Network Support ?! (maybe)

------------ 1.1 Needed software --------------
libxml2

Ubuntu:
	apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev

------------ 1.2 Compile --------------

Simply type:
make

Now, all executables and the lib should be in the bin/ directory.
To copy the binaries to system do as follows(on debian based):

sudo make install

------------ 2.1 Access Rights for USB HID device ---------------

This software accesses the Aqua Computer via the HID linux kernel driver.
So there is no need for external libraries like "LibUSB", which normally can only be used as root.
After plugging an HID peripheral the operating system creates a device 
	/dev/usb/hiddevX
where X is a progressive number. Per default this device is also only read and writeable by root, 
but there are several sulotions to change that.

You could change the rights to communicate with it by:
	sudo chmod a+r /dev/usb/hiddev0

Pro: Very easy an fast
Con: You have to do it after EVERY boot or EVERY time you re-plug the device.
	

To permanently enable the access to the HID device a user do the following 
(on Ubuntu and other Debian based distributions, check for others): 

For "Aquastream XT" - as root create a file 
/etc/udev/rules.d/99-hiddev.rules if you want to enable a user group write:

	KERNEL=="hiddev[0-9]", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="f0b6", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0c70", GROUP="<group>" 

where <group> is one of the user groups (to get a list type "groups"); select a suitable group and if your user desn't belong to it execute.

	addgroup <user> <group>
	
	groupmems -a <user> -g <group> 
	
	
	Or, if you want to enable all users, change reading permissions:	
	KERNEL=="hiddev[0-9]", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="f0b6", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0c70", MODE="0664"

	
	99-hiddev.rules is there as an example file.
	
	
restart udev to apply changes:
	/etc/init.d/udev reload
if this does not work:
	>udevadm control --reload-rules
and replug device
