------------ 1.0 What is "libacinfo" --------------

This library implements a generic and easy interface
for Aqua Computer (AC) USB devices. It was initially developed
because there was no linux tool to monitor the information
of an "Aquastream XT".
It is planned to support more AC devices.

Supported Hardware:

	- Aquastream XT
	
	
TODO:
	- complete sample application(s)
	- give small intro in Wiki

------------ 1.1 Needed software --------------
libxml2

Ubuntu:
	apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev

------------ 1.2 Compile --------------

make
sudo make install

------------ 2.1 Access Rights for USB HID device ---------------

This software accesses the Aqua Computer via the HID linux kernel driver.
So there is no need for external libraries like "LibUSB", which normally can only be used as root.
After plugging an HID peripheral the operating system creates a device 
	/dev/usb/hiddevX
where X is a progressive number. Per default this device is also only read and writeable by root, 
but there are several sulotions to change that.

You could change the rights to communicate with it by:
	sudo chmod a+r /dev/usb/hiddev0

Pro: Very easy an fast
Con: You have to do it after EVERY boot or EVERY time you re-plug the device.
	

To permanently enable the access to the HID device a user do the following 
(on Ubuntu and other Debian based distributions, check for others): 

For "Aquastream XT" - as root create a file 
/etc/udev/rules.d/99-hiddev.rules if you want to enable a user group write:

	KERNEL=="hiddev[0-9]", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="f0b6", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0c70", GROUP="<group>" 

where <group> is one of the user groups (to get a list type "groups"); select a suitable group and if your user desn't belong to it execute.

	addgroup <user> <group>
	
	groupmems -a <user> -g <group> 
	
	
	Or, if you want to enable all users, change reading permissions:	
	KERNEL=="hiddev[0-9]", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="f0b6", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0c70", MODE="0664"

	
	99-hiddev.rules is there as an example file.
	
	
restart udev to apply changes:
	/etc/init.d/udev reload
if this does not work:
	>udevadm control --reload-rules
and replug device



------------ 3.0 History -------------------

22.09.2009 
	First version and prototype based on libUSB

23.09.2009
	Ported to USB Human Interface Device (HID) kernel API

15.11.2009
	Started Network TCP-Support, but realized that Aquasuite 
	does not support this for other devices than "Aquaero"

05.06.2010
	Converted my initial application to a generic library.
